What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

In general, I still felt like I needed more reps practicing the Git and GitHub workflows. Also merging branches locally vs on GitHub wasn't that clear to me. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Merging locally and merging on Github, and updating local repos after changes are merged on GitHub (pulling)

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked the guide about the workflow for pulling GitHub changes to local computer. I asked my pair about tracking branches and merges in GitHub and how to view them. (I asked other questions I just don't remember them all right now, they just came up in the moment)

What still confuses you about Git?

I think I mostly just need to practice the workflow more. Some of the commands come more readily to me, but the merging and pushing commands could use some more reps.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Better than I expected! I think my partner and I did a good job communicating throughout, and overall learned a lot through working together.
